题目描述
For the home economics community service enterprises, an hourly employee makes money according to how long the work takes. Therefore, the result of this mathematic expression indicates the work hours of somebody. And letters here indicate a period of time, so any letter in this mathematic expression consists of three integers that represent hours, minutes and seconds separately. For example, letter A is assigned number: 12 34 56, namely letter A indicates the time for work is 12 hours 34 minutes 56 seconds.
输入
An integer m is input indicates how many periods of time, and there are 2m integers in the next line that represent the time. Please make sure all data are legitimate. 
输出
The result of adding for the mathematic expression also consists of three integers. However, if the second or third integer is less than 0 the data is not legitimate and output the character “not legitimate”.
