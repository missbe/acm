题目描述
Friendly numbers is another name of the amicable numbers. There are 2 integers a and b, if a equal to the sum of b’s factors that excluding b-self, and b equal to the sum of a’s factors that excluding a-self, then a and b are a pair of amicable numbers. It’s just like the friendship between two different numbers.
For example, all factors of number 220, excluding itself, are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, add the other factors: 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110 = 284;
Meanwhile, all factors of number 284, excluding itself, are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, add the other factors:   1+2+4+71+142 = 220.
    Now, you could program to judge the numbers, which are given and less than 105, are a pair of friendly numbers or not.

输入
An integer m is input indicates how many pair of numbers, and the each follow line including 2 numbers to be judged.

输出
If the given numbers are friendly numbers, output a character “yes”, otherwise output “no”.
